# Contemporary-Topics-in-Computer-Architecture-Workshop

My solved exercises in the course Contemporary Topics in Computer Architecture Workshop

INTRODUCTION:

In this lab, students have the opportunity to define their own computer architecture at the machine language level and implement it by writing the appropriate microprograms. They are then able to write programs and run them on the computer with the architecture they have defined. This possibility is provided by using the emulator of a microprogrammable computer designed and developed in the Computer Technology and Architecture laboratory of our department. The emulator gives many possibilities such as writing microprograms and programs in symbolic language.

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:

Development of microprograms in 'symbolic' language for the microprocessor ΑΤ91

VERSION or DATE: SPRING 2020

The doc and txt reports were originally written in Greek and were translated by me so they may have some mistakes in the translation :)

Thank you for your time!
