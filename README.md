# Contemporary-Topics-in-Computer-Architecture-Workshop

My solved exercises in the course Contemporary Topics in Computer Architecture Workshop

INTRODUCTION:

In this lab, students have the opportunity to define their own computer architecture at the machine language level and implement it by writing the appropriate microprograms. They are then able to write programs and run them on the computer with the architecture they have defined. This possibility is provided by using the emulator of a microprogrammable computer designed and developed in the Computer Technology and Architecture laboratory of our department. The emulator gives many possibilities such as writing microprograms and programs in symbolic language.
The AT91 platform breaks a long tradition of the Hardware & Architecture Sector
of the Department of Computer and Informatics Engineering: the tradition of designing from scratch the platforms of our laboratory courses.
Although the authors were faced with the dilemma of "building something from scratch" or "to
rely on something ready and build on it', there were several reasons that
they pushed us to the second solution:

• Supporting any custom-made system is extremely difficult
in the academic environment where the faces are constantly changing.

• Developing support tools (emulators, debuggers, ...) is extremely laborious.

• Developing from scratch requires a very large investment of time, with doubts
Results.

The AT91 platform hardware is essentially a commercially available development board (AT91SAM9261EK from ATMEL). On this board we can
develop hardware and software applications for the AT91SAM9261 microcontroller,
which is an enriched implementation by the ATMEL company of the processor
Advanced Risc Machines (ARM) ARM926EJ-S


PURPOSE OF PROJECT:

Development of microprograms in 'symbolic' language for the development board ΑΤ91

VERSION or DATE: SPRING 2020

The doc and txt reports were originally written by me in Greek and they were translated by me so there may be some mistakes (grammar) :)

Thank you for your time!
